# MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline Error: Incorrect $group Usage

This repository demonstrates a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines involving the `$group` operator when handling null or undefined values.  The example shows an aggregation pipeline intended to count the occurrences of values in a specific field.  However, the pipeline may produce incorrect results or throw errors when encountering null or undefined values in that field.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous pipeline. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  The corrected version utilizes the `$ifNull` operator to handle null values appropriately and ensures accurate counting.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Start a MongoDB instance.
3. Import sample data into a collection (see example in bug.js or bugSolution.js for creating a sample collection)
4. Run `bug.js` to observe the erroneous output.
5. Run `bugSolution.js` to observe the corrected output.
